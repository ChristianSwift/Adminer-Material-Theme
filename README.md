# Adminer-Material-Theme

A new theme for Adminer which is inspired the material design language.

[Adminer](https://www.adminer.org/) is one of the best DB-Management tools out there... with the catch that it doesn't look any good at all.

### Usage
* Get a copy of [Adminer](https://www.adminer.org/).
* Download the adminer.css (or adminer.scss, see the customization section below) from this project.
* Put them both in the same web folder.
* You are done.

### Customization
* A SASS file is available under ``/src``, allowing you to set the primary color, inactive color, and header color to customize the theme to your taste. You may then run the grunt task.

### Notes
* Works best in Google Chrome
* Please report rendering issues
