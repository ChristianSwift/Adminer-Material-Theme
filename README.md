# Adminer-Material-Theme

A theme for Adminer inspired the material design language.

[Adminer](https://www.adminer.org/) is one of the best DB-Management tools out there...

... with the catch that it doesn't look good any good at all.

### Usage
* Get a copy of [Adminer](https://www.adminer.org/).
* Download the adminer.css (or adminer.scss, see the Customization section below) from this project.
* Put them both in the same web folder.
* You are done.

### Customization
* A SASS file is available in the ``/resources`` folder, allowing you to set the primary colour, inactive colour, and header colour to customize the theme to your tastes. 
* The SASS file was adapted from the uncompressed CSS file, available [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arcs-/Adminer-Material-Theme/master/resources/adminer.uncompressed.css).

### Notes
* Works best in Google Chrome
* Please report render issues
