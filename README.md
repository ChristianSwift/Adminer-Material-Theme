# Adminer-Material-Theme

A theme for Adminer inspired the material design language.

Adminer is one of the best DB-Magamenet tools out there...
...with the catch that it looks horrible.


Adminer: [Adminer](https://www.adminer.org/).


### Usage
* You'll need [Adminer](https://www.adminer.org/) itself
* And downlaod the [adminer.css](https://github.com/arcs-/Adminer-Material-Theme/archive/master.zip) theme from here
* Put them both in a folder - done
