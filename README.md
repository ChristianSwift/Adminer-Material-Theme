# Adminer-Material-Theme

A theme for Adminer with the material design language in mind, at least sometimes.

Adminer is one of the best DB-Magamenet tools out there..

...with the catch that it looks horrible.


Adminer: [Adminer](https://www.adminer.org/). 

### Usage
* You will have to downlaod [Adminer](https://www.adminer.org/) itself.. 
* And downlaod the [adminer.css](https://github.com/arcs-/Adminer-Material-Theme/archive/master.zip) from here
* Put them both in a folder - done
